Context of the challenge

Currently there is a database from the company Numismática México, which includes sales of coins, banknotes, centenaries among other items of this nature. Its method of operation is online specifically in the Marketplace, which allows it to obtain valuable customer prospecting information for each transaction that is executed.

Numismatic Mexico has already detected that sales increase at the end of the year, which is why it requests a descriptive analysis that answers specific questions for the months of November and December. Based on the required questions, we will seek to analyze the information to provide valuable findings to our client.

Being close to the end of the year events, Numismática México seeks to rely on data from past periods to be able to carry out an appropriate commercial strategy and maximize its sales at said events.



The objective will be to analyze the information provided and extract findings that contribute to the objective of this case. Likewise, make these findings known visually, in order to make appropriate decisions for the strategy.
